# Ideas
Just a place to throw down some ideas for projects that we have. It's definetly going to be just a README for now. But let's just start capturing ideas, concepts, protocols, anything we can really to get a better grasp on what we want to create.

## Balancing Robot (Curtis 03/04/2020)
I've been wanting to build a balancing robot for quite some time. I figured if I'm able to 3D print the structure and use some off the shelf components to prototype a balancing robot we could take that one step further. Implement the wirewireio protocol to actually control the robot in x and y planar dimensions while utilizing that remote control you spoke of to control it. 

There could be different modes:
 - Robot or car control mode
 - Analog clock mode
   - It would kind of tick and tock back and fourth for seconds
   - It could have a display that shows the time or timer countdown
 - Some way to make it edjucational for students where they could write their own code
